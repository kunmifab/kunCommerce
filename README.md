## About KunCommerce

KunCommerce is an ecommerce website created using Laravel Framework due to the fact it can be used to build websites seemlessly; frontend using the blade files and backend. 
KunCommerce is unique because it has some features that an ecommerce site must have to be functioning adequately, some of these features are:

- [Integrated payment gateway (Stripe)].
- [Added an admin control that would be able to oversee everything that goes on].
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM].

I used because Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
